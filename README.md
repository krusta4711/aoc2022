**Advent of Code 2022**

My solutions for the great Advent of Code 2022 taks (https://adventofcode.com/2022) in java. The code is not always pefectly clean as I often try out things just to try them out (e.g. single liners with streams). ;-)

**Day 1**

The task itself was as easy as it gets. But part 2 put me into an internal brain controversy whether I create a clean solution with managing just the actual three highest calories or whether I use the dirty version an put everything in a list and sort it. The dirty version has won. ;-)

**Day 2**

German: Stein, Schere, Papier. I implemented this one with enums.

---

**Day 3**

I wasn't pleased  with my solution. It was neither a nice design nor short. On reddit I found a crazy oneliner which challenged me to use a single steam too on day 4. Let's see. ;-)

---

**Day 4**

As intended, I used only a single stream. Was tough as I'm not a fan of hard do read single line code. But was fun too.

---

**Day 5**

The solution was easy but the parsing led to ugly code. Nevertheless, a good one to use the Deque interface and a little bit of regex training.

---

**Day 6**

This was the easiest puzzle ever. Felt more like day a day 1 puzzle. Especially for part 2 it was just changing the chunks from 4 to 14.

**Day 7**

Nice one. I was thinking of just maintaining the directories and their sizes but then decided that a full tree with recursion is easier.

**Day 8**

A good old grid/matrix exercise by Advent of Code. I don't like to use hundreds of loops in loops. Additionally accessing a grid/matrix in a loop can drive one crazy when using i and j as loop index and borders have to be taken into account. So I tried a different solution this time. I didn't fill the grid with integers but with instances of my own class 'Tree' which all know their siblings. In that class I used recursion to calculate the solutions. So I didn't have to mess around with indices and borders. My Tree class can maybe still be slimed down a bit. Using A Non-Tree instance instead of null might be solution too.
