**Advent of Code 2022**

---

**Day 1**

The task itself was as easy as it gets. But part 2 put me into an internal brain controversy whether I create a clean solution with managing just the actual three highest calories or whether I use the dirty version an put everything in a list and sort it. The dirty version has won. ;-)

**Day 2**

Stein, Schere, Papier. I imlplemented one wih classes to have a nice architecture.

---

**Day 3**

I wasn't pleaaed with my solution. It was neither a nice design nore short. On reddit I found a crazy oneliner which challenged me to use a single steam too on day 4. Let's see. ;-)

---

**Day 4**

As intended I used only a single stream. Was tough as I'm not a fan of hard do read single line code. But was fun too.

---

**Day 5**

The solution was easy but the parsing led to ugly code. Nevertheless a good one to use the "new" Deque interface (instead of Stack) and a little bit of regex traing.
